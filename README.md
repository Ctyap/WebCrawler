# WebCrawler
Implemented the core of a Web crawler, and then crawled the following URLs (to be considered as domains for the purposes of this assignment) and paths: 

*.ics.uci.edu/*

*.cs.uci.edu/*

*.informatics.uci.edu/*

*.stat.uci.edu/*

today.uci.edu/department/information_computer_sciences/*

Recorded the how many uniques paged were found, the longest page in terms of the number of words, the 50 most common words found under those domains, and how many subdomains were found in the ics.uci,edu.
