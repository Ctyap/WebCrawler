# WebCrawler
In this project, I implemented the core of a Web crawler, and then crawled the following URLs (to be considered as domains for the purposes of this assignment) and paths: 

*.ics.uci.edu/*
*.cs.uci.edu/*
*.informatics.uci.edu/*
*.stat.uci.edu/*
today.uci.edu/department/information_computer_sciences/*

I recorded the how many uniques paged I found, the longest page in terms of the number of words, the 50 most common words found under those domains, and how many subdomains I found in the ics.uci,edu.
