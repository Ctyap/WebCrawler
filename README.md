# WebCrawler
In this project, I implemented the core of a Web crawler, and then crawled the following URLs (to be considered as domains for the purposes of this assignment) and paths:  *.ics.uci.edu/* *.cs.uci.edu/* *.informatics.uci.edu/* *.stat.uci.edu/* today.uci.edu/department/information_computer_sciences/*
